A simple command-line HTTP server.

It launches a server in the current working directory and serves all files in it.

## Get started

Download the .NET Core SDK [2.1.300](https://aka.ms/DotNetCore21) or newer.
Once installed, run this command:

```
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-serve
```

Start a simple server and open the browser by running

```
dotnet serve -o
```

..and with HTTPS.
```
dotnet serve -o -S
```

## Configuring HTTPS

`dotnet serve -S` will serve requests over HTTPS. By default, it will attempt to find an appropriate certificate
on the machine.

By default, `dotnet serve` will look for, in order:
 - A pair of files named `cert.pem` and `private.key` in the current directory
 - A file named `cert.pfx` in the current directory
 - The ASP.NET Core Developer Certificate (localhost only)

You can also manually specify certificates as command line options (see below):

> _See also [this doc](./docs/GenerateCert.md) for how to create a self-signed HTTPS certificate._

### .pem files

Use this when you have your certficate and private key stored in separate files (PEM encoded).
```
dotnet serve --cert ./cert.pem --key ./private.pem
```

Note: currently only RSA private keys are supported.

### .pfx file

You can generate a self-signed

Use this when you have your certficate as a .pfx/.p12 file (PKCS#12 format).
```
dotnet serve --pfx myCert.pfx --pfx-pwd certPass123
```

### Using the ASP.NET Core Developer Certificate

The developer certificate is automatically created the first time you use `dotnet`.
When serving on 'localhost', dotnet-serve will discover and use when you run:

```
dotnet serve -S
```
